    "# 2. A/B Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, I demonstrate how to define and start A/B tests and analyse the results of it. As preprocessing, identifying major metrics and defining them are required. Building hypothesis - null and alternative comes before analysing the results to measure and determine the success of tests. As a practice project, a fictional digital product, Kittengram - a social network platform for posting pictures of cats - is used to see if new features can bring values and to decide whether to  deploy them.\n",
