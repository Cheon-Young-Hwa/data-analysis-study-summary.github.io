    "# 2. A/B Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, I demonstrate how to define and start A/B tests and analyse the results of it. As preprocessing, identifying major metrics and defining them are required. Building hypothesis - null and alternative comes before analysing the results to measure and determine the success of tests. \n",
    "\n",
    "To practice skills and appy knowlege, I carried out a small project using a fictional digital product, Kittengram - a social network platform for posting pictures of cats. The aim of the project is to test if a new feature on the app increases uder actitivity and click-through-rate (CTR). I did exploratory analysis, calculating sample size and t-test with Python code. These process breaks down to 3 parts saved to different files as listed below. \n",
