    "# 3. Linear Regression Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This secession explores one of the fundamental machine learning topics, linear regerssion, from preprocessing (cleaning and transforming, scaling data), to plotting regression to making predictions and comparing to testing. I practiced this whole process through 3 different projects during a machine learning model course I took.  \n",
