This is a case study project bound to the Google Data Analytics certification course to demonstarte data analysis skills and knowlege learned during the course.
I used spreadsheets and R as main analysing tools for the project.


## Project introduction
This report is based on a ficitional case study of which materials were provided by Google Data Analytics course. The analysis task is to analyse datasets about users of a bike-sharing company and propose marketing strategies and enhance profitability.

* About the company and backgrounds
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago.

Until now, Cyclisticâ€™s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members. 


## Statement of a business task
The goal is to design marketing strategies that help convert casual riders into annual members. In order to achieve the goal, these questions have to be answered.

* How annual members and casual riders differ?
* Why casual riders would buy a membership?
* How digital media could affect their marketing tactics?
