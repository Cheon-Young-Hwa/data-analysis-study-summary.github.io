    "# 4. Logistic Regression Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression allows us to analyse datat and make predictions with outcomes that are not numerical but categorical. This machine-learning course introduces how to interpret the model summary by understanding concepts like coefficients, intercepts, pseudo R-squared, and p-value. To calculate accuracy of the model predictions, confusion matrix is created.\n",
